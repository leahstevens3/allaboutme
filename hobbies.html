        <p class="text">A hobby of mine that I enjoy doing in my free time is painting! Throughout highschool and even now, I love painting things for my friends and family. A cool thing I did in high school was that I volunteered to 
            paint our graduating classes "senior square", which was a concret slab in the middle of our quad. Painting is something that I do to relieve stress whenever I am feeling overwhlemed.  </p>
